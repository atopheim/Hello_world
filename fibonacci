    #Fibonacci sequencer, by atopheim
    #- any number is the sum of the two previous numbers.

    #If no changes to the program are made, then the program will print out the standard fibonacci sequence.
    #If one would like to start at different initial values, then just use the commented code for fib1 and fib2

    fib2 = 1 #fib2 = input("Write the second reference in the Fibonacci sequence")
